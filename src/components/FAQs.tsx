    question: "What does BT WebTech do?",
    answer:
      "BT WebTech is a custom web development and software agency. We build professional websites, scalable web applications, and AI-powered systems using modern technologies like React, Next.js, FastAPI, Django, and Node.js — not templates or drag-and-drop tools."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use WordPress or website builders?",
    answer:
      "No. We do not build websites with WordPress, Wix, or drag-and-drop builders. Every project is fully custom-coded, which means better performance, stronger security, easier scaling, and no dependence on plugins or themes that can break over time."
  },
  {
    question: "Who is BT WebTech best suited for?",
    answer:
      "We work with startups, businesses, and founders who need more than a basic website. If you need speed, scalability, integrations, dashboards, AI automation, or a system that grows with your business, BT WebTech is built for you."
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies do you use?",
    answer:
      "Our core stack includes React, Next.js, FastAPI, Django, Node.js, and modern databases. These technologies power high-performance platforms used by top startups and enterprises, allowing us to build fast, secure, and future-proof solutions."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build AI-powered solutions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We design and integrate AI solutions such as chatbots, workflow automation, smart content systems, data analysis tools, and custom AI features that improve efficiency and reduce operational costs."
  },
  {
    question: "How secure are your websites and applications?",
    answer:
      "Security is built in from day one. We avoid risky third-party plugins, follow best security practices, and build clean architectures that reduce vulnerabilities commonly found in CMS-based websites."
  },
  {
    question: "Can my website or app scale as my business grows?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Our solutions are built like real software, not static sites. Whether you’re launching an MVP or expanding into a full platform, your product is designed to scale without needing a rebuild."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical project take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on the scope, but most projects are delivered in days or weeks — not months. We provide clear timelines, consistent communication, and predictable delivery from start to launch."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing support after launch?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We provide long-term support, improvements, and system evolution. BT WebTech works as a technical partner, not a one-time vendor, helping your product grow alongside your business."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I get started with BT WebTech?",
    answer:
      "Simply contact us via WhatsApp or our website. We’ll discuss your goals, recommend the right solution, and outline a clear path to building a high-performance product tailored to your needs."
